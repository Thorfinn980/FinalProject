# Hypnotic Beef

Team Name: Red Solo Cup

Team Member: Kevin Xiong

## Project Description

The goal of this project was to develop a platformer game that utilized the libGDX framework and Box2D physics engine. The game includes various obstacles that the player must overcome to progress toward the end.

## How to Install
Download the file and run the .jar file or run through IDE with requirements.

## How to Install Without the Requirements
Use the command ./gradlew desktop:dist to deploy the application and run the jar file.

## How to Play
Hypnotic Beef is a platformer game that features simple physics-based gameplay and some special abilities for the player character.
The basic controls for the game are as follows:

Use the WASD keys to move the player character around the level.
Press the Spacebar to jump in the air. Press it again to perform a double jump, allowing you to reach higher places.
Press the Left Shift key to blink in the air, allowing you to move quickly and evade obstacles.
Objectives
The goal of each level is to reach the end by traversing through obstacles and avoiding hazards.

## Requirements for Running in IDE
* Java version "17.*"
* Gradle Version "7.5.1"

## Troubleshooting
One known bug in the game is that the program may crash when the player character dies or when the game ends if the jar file is run directly. To avoid this issue, it is recommended to run the game through your IDE.

## Credits
The libGDX framework and Box2D physics engine were used to develop the game.
The majority of the game assets were sourced from itch.io, with the addition of Sound effects obtained from various sources. Lastly a big thanks to my older brother for providing player character assets.
